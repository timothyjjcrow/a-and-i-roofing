## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Clean, professional appearance with consistent branding
- **Improved Navigation**: Intuitive menu structure with dropdown capabilities
- **Contact Form**: User-friendly form with validation for customer inquiries
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Filterable gallery of completed roofing projects
- **Service Pages**: Detailed information on each roofing type offered
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized code and images for quick loading
- **SEO Friendly**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML for better search visibility

## Images

For a complete implementation, you'll need to add real photos to the `images` directory:

- Professional photos of completed roofing projects
- Team photos
- Community involvement images
- Service-specific images
- Hero banner images

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS variables for consistent styling)
- JavaScript (vanilla JS for interactivity)
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome icons

## Implementation Notes

1. **FontAwesome Integration**: The site uses FontAwesome for icons. You may need to create an account and update the script reference.

2. **Contact Form Processing**: The contact form needs backend processing to be implemented (PHP, Node.js, or a form service like Formspree).

3. **Placeholder Images**: All image references should be updated with actual project photos.

4. **Additional Pages**: The metal-roofing.html, torch-down-roofing.html, and wood-roofing.html pages need to be created following the pattern of composition-roofing.html.
